# Language Instructions/Examples

Each language will need to reference the [Control Registers documentation](/docs/control.md). Some platforms, such as Rust, have statically generated types to access these registers.

* [C/C++](./c/README.md)
* [Rust](./rust/README.md)

If you would like to contribute instructions or examples for a language, feel free to open a PR.
