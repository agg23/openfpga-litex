# Rust Example: interact

`make interact`

A demo of the Pocket `interact.json` functionality integrated into the core. Requires copying the included `interact.json` file into the `/Cores/agg23.RISCV` directory.

Manipulating the values in `Core Settings` while the program is running will print the updated values as they are sent to the core.
